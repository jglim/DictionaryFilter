DictionaryFilter
=========

Filter your wordlists by length, character sets, and starting letters

This utility allows you to filter your wordlists by length, character sets and starting letters to generate a lighter wordlist. 
You can also use it to export multiple cases of a word (upper/lower/proper case) and remove duplicates.

No external dependencies - only requires .NET Framework 4. Might work on Mono (untested)
